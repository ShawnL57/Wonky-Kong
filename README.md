Wonky Kong is an interactive game developed in C++ that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles while replicating the gameplay of the classic Donkey Kong. The game is structured around an actor-based architecture where each game entity (such as the Player, Kong, Barrels, and Fireballs) is an instance of a class, leveraging inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

The game world is managed by the StudentWorld class, which extends the provided GameWorld class. This class initializes the game environment, tracks all active actors in an STL container (such as std::vector or std::list), and processes each game tick by calling the doSomething() method of each actor. The actors, including obstacles like Floor and Ladder, as well as dynamic enemies like Fireball and Koopa, are derived from a base Actor class, which itself inherits from GraphObject to enable animation and movement.

Gameplay mechanics include player-controlled movement (jumping, climbing ladders, and dodging obstacles) with real-time input handling through getKey(), enemy AI that follows predefined movement patterns, and interactive elements like Garlic Goodies that grant burp attacks and Bonfires that destroy barrels. The Level class is used to load grid-based levels from external data files, ensuring modularity and scalability.

With structured game logic, efficient memory management using proper object lifecycle handling in init(), move(), and cleanUp(), and an emphasis on reusable OOP design patterns, Wonky Kong serves as both an educational tool for learning C++ and an engaging retro-style game experience.
